The Bubble of Knowledge - Working Copy

general info - this module is being designed for a party of 3 to 4 adventurers at level 2 but most of it can work for any level.

Location overview
	Floating Library surrounded by a magical bubble shield - the floating island is not visible on cloudy days
	
	INN - The Crater's Edge - built on the edge of the crater left by the library incident

people (NPC)
	Lizard Beastborn - Performer - has a ship that can fly to the library
	Elf/orc - Proprietor of the INN - gives the quest to collect an item from the library. (this is a lie to trick the party into destroying the library)

Scene 1
	Party arrives in the INN. 
	The Proprietor will thank them for answering their quest request. And informs them that they are needed to retrieve the scepter from the second floor of the library.
	"It is an old family heirloom that was left in the library during the evacuation. It would mean a lot if you could get it back for me."
	
	If the party asks they are told that they will get 10 gold for their troubles.
	
	Then they say that there is a performer that will be a temporary resident of the INN that can provide a ride to the floating island.
	
	The party is told that the performer is outside unloading their equipment and are asked if they can help to speed up the process.
